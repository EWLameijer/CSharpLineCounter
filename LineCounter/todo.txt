1) Continue the cycle: build, run unit tests, test self, test others, release
2) check the release: 
2) goal 1: also give directory to distinguish between Program.cs and Program.cs
3) goal 2: add someString to correctly count multiline strings
4) become resistant against {} records and inner classes
5) note: POSSIBLE bug with end of block comment split over 2 lines. Is now seen as end, in reality isn't. 
Likely not super-important, though. But I guess I should work with tokens, not characters.

Check problems in code!
/:/ experiment: perhaps Roslyn would make things better?
/:? experiment: make your own parse tree, or use ANTLR?

10 coding. (evening?)

Coding:
1) a) fix method length bug GetRegularCode (perhaps first simplify to state machine,
   that failing, print code?)
   b) run unit tests
   c) run 5 test data 
   d) all clear: commit and make release

2 a) Fix {} from record in FountainOfObjects 
   b) run unit tests
   c) run 5 test data
   d) all clear: commit and make release
 
1? badly named fields?
2? methods or properties whose names start with lowercase?
4? Repeated code?
